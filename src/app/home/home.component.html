            Buying a vehicle is one of life’s biggest dreams. 
            But it is also a huge investment that can take away a lot of life’s savings. 
            But there is a way in which you can afford a vehicle, without dipping too much into your savings – by taking a vehicle loan. 
            This way you do not have to compromise on the vehicle type, and pay for it in affordable Equated Monthly Instalments or EMIs.

            Every lending institution follows the KYC (Know Your Customer) norms for granting loans. There is a certain set of documentation that needs to be completed and verified along with your credit record to fulfil the approval of a car loan. Prior to shopping for a car, it can help to get a pre-approved car loan car financing officer from the lender of choice. This guarantees faster processing of the car loan but most importantly, a pre-approved car loan also works as an additional leverage while negotiating with the car dealer. 
            You will be in a better position to bargain for more add-ons or fewer fees while closing the deal.
